# Storybook

Every book at my home has special meaning to me. There's a book I got as
a birthday gift; one my father bought and read when he was young man and gave
me when I entered college; one I borrowed from a friend I can't get in contact
anymore; and so on.

I wanted a place to record all those lovely but fleeting memories.

## Current goals

* Record personal memories and thoughts for each book
* Build and maintain own bookshelf

## Potential goals

* Automatic book addition through ISBN barcode recognition
* Share stories about a particular book with others
* Book lending network based on user bookshelves
* Location-based book clubs for a particular book
